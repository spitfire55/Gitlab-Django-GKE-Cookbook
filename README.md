# Django + Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) + Gitlab CI Cookbook

This repo contains the config files necessary to setup a fully functional
Django application that runs within Google's Kubernetes Engine. Your Django
code should be hosted in a Gitlab repo with a runner pointing to your
implementation of this cookbook.

TODO: Write bash script that accepts user input to simply
`sed s/default_stuff/your_stuff` and auto-deploy (assuming you do required
work within Google Cloud Platform).
